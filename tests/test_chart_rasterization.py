"""Rasterizing a chart needs a browser — say so when there isn't one.

Reported from a live session: ``generate_map_chart_gif`` failed, and the
agent rebuilt a worse version of it by hand rather than reporting the
real problem. The traceback was:

    ChromeNotFoundError: Kaleido v1 and later requires Chrome to be
    installed.
      at outputLib/thumbs.py:3967 -> fig.to_image(...)

Nothing was wrong with the function. A Plotly figure is JavaScript, so
turning one into a PNG means running a browser. kaleido 0.x bundled its
own Chromium; kaleido 1.0 removed it and looks for a browser already on
the machine. ``python:3.12-slim`` has none.

geeViz declared kaleido only under the ``mcp`` extra and unpinned, so a
rebuild after 1.0 shipped silently swapped a self-contained renderer for
one with an external dependency. The same shape as starlette-admin
0.x -> 1.0 breaking the admin panel: a major version crossed on its own
and changed a runtime contract.

Four shipped features rasterize charts, so all four broke at once — and
so did ``html_to_png``, which drives a browser directly for Sankey PNGs
and had been returning None the whole time.
